# sathytrench.github.io

A personal portfolio site built with [Create-React-App](https://create-react-app.dev/) and deployed with Github Pages. Designed with JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. I wanted to showcase my love of pixel animation, and for the projects to "flip" like tarot cards. Let me know what you think or if you spot a bug ^__^

### `npm start`
